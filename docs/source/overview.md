# Overview
The epigraphhub library is designed to provide external users with all of the analytical functionality used to power the EpigraphHub platform and applications. In fact, all applications designed to run on the EpigraphHub platform rely heavily on it.

This library should be used by users that want to contribute to the platform as well as by users that want the borrow some of the tools developed by our team in other opensource projects.
